      <p>Always start with a clean vase filled with fresh lukewarm water.</p>
      <p>
        Add the complimentary sachet of flower food that comes with each Sage &
        Blanca bouquet or arrangement into your vase of water. Make sure to
        follow the guidelines on each sachet, as instructions may vary. Strip
        off any leaves that will fall below the waterline, as these will promote
        bacterial growth causing the flowers to wilt quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cut 2-3cm off each stem using a clean sharp knife or scissors. Always
        cut at a sharp angle so the stems can absorb water more effectively, and
        place flowers directly in vase. Display the flowers in a cool, light
        location away from direct sunlight
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid placing your flowers directly under a fan or heater; flowers are
        sensitive to extreme hot or cold temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Top up the water in the vase daily, and remove any faded flowers as they
        appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every two to three days, re-cut flower stems and replace water with a
        fresh supply.
